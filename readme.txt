[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
So, you want to run a family friendly community, without any vulgar words appearing on your site. The easiest way to prevent that is to use SMF's word censor feature, but you have an empty list of words and don't want to spend an hour filling in every naughty word you know and some you don't.

Word Censor List will help you by adding a list of some commonly censored words and some uncommon ones to your forum.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.5, but should work on earlier versions of SMF 2.0.x.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
